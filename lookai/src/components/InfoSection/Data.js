    "According to the World Health Organization, there are around 253 million people who are visually impaired. Around 36 million of them are blind, while the remaining 217 million have other vision problems. Around 80% of these people are 50 or older. The visually impaired face numerous challenges in daily life, including mobility and socialization. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) models can aid in face detection and recognition, age, gender, and emotion prediction, as well as staircase and currency detection. These models analyze and process visual data, making them well-suited for complex image recognition tasks. The proposed system utilizes DL and computer vision techniques to provide real-time feedback to the user via an audio interface, assisting with mobility, socialization, and currency identification. AI is crucial for processing and analyzing visual data and accurately identifying different objects.",
